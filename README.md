# JobFlow

A full-stack job application tracking system built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

JobFlow allows users to manage their job search efficiently with authentication, user-specific data, and a clean dashboard experience.

---

## 🔍 Overview

JobFlow is designed to simulate a production-like job tracking product where users can:

- create and manage job applications
- track progress across different application stages
- view analytics such as response count and response rate
- securely access only their own job data

This project focuses on building a realistic full-stack application with authentication, REST API integration, database persistence, and thoughtful UI/UX decisions.

## 🧠 Key Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication

- JWT-based login and registration
- token stored in localStorage
- protected routes (frontend + backend)
- backend middleware verifies token

### 2. User Data Isolation

- each job linked to authenticated user
- queries filtered by `userId`
- prevents cross-user data access

### 3. Custom Hooks

- `useJobs` → CRUD + API integration
- `useApplicationFilters` → search, filter, sort
- `useJobForm` → form state and validation

### 4. Analytics

- total applications, interviews, offers, rejections
- response count and response rate
- latest activity tracking

### 5. UI/UX

- clean grayscale UI with clear hierarchy
- status-based color indicators
- responsive layout with sidebar navigation
- empty states for new users
- notes support for tracking details
